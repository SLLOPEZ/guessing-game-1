# Megan's Guessing Game
## Class demo for 201n2 guessing game
This is a page that I made in Code201 to have ask a user questions about myself and see if they can answer correctly!
## What I learned:
The topics that I learned while writing this page were:
* how to prompt a user
* how to alert a user
* how to print to the console
* if/else statements
* separation of concerns
* for loops
